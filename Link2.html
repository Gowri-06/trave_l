    <p style="font-size: 25px" >Despite the immense progress in artificial intelligence in recent years,<br>AI and robots are still dumb in many ways,<br> especially when it comes to solving new problems or navigating unfamiliar environments.<br> They lack the human ability, found even in young children,<br> to learn how the world works and apply that general knowledge to new situations.<br></br>

        One promising approach to improving the skills of AI is to expand its senses;<br> currently AI with computer vision or audio recognition can sense things but cannot “talk”<br> about what it sees and hears using natural-language algorithms. But what if you combined these abilities in a single AI system?<br> Might these systems begin to gain human-like intelligence? Might a robot that can see, feel, hear,<br> and communicate be a more productive human assistant? Karen Hao explains how AIs with multiple senses will gain a greater understanding of the world around them,<br> achieving a much more flexible intelligence.
