    </center>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">We all use GPS every day; it has transformed our lives and many of our businesses.<br> But while today’s GPS is accurate to within 5 to 10 meters,<br> new hyper-accurate positioning technologies have accuracies within a few centimeters or millimeters.<br> That’s opening up new possibilities, from landslide warnings to delivery robots and self-driving cars that can safely navigate streets.<br></br>
        China’s BeiDou (Big Dipper) global navigation system was completed in June 2020 and is part of what’s making all this possible.<br> It provides positioning accuracy of 1.5 to two meters to anyone in the world.<br> Using ground-based augmentation, it can get down to millimeter-level accuracy.<br> Meanwhile, GPS, which has been around since the early 1990s, is getting an upgrade: four new satellites for GPS III launched in November and more are expected in orbit by 2023.<br> Ling Xin reports on how the greatly increased accuracy of these systems is already proving useful.
